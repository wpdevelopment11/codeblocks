Don't speculate, measure.
Early to bed and early to rise makes a man healthy, wealthy, and wise.

    ```
    import os

    def foo():
        for i in range(10):
            print(i)

    def foobar():
        pass

    foo()
    ```

A picture is worth a thousand words.
User interfaces are hard to build.

```

#!/bin/bash

case $var in
    foo) echo "Cool!";;
    bar) echo "Not cool!";;
    *) echo "blah";;
esac
```

A penny for your thoughts.
